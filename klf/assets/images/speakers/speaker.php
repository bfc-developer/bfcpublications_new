				Farhat Ehsas is one of the most prominent post-modern Urdu poets in India. Though steeped in the classical Persian and Urdu poetic tradition, he has over the years mastered a poetic idiom which while drawing freely from the classical aesthetics is able to express the yearnings, pains and sufferings and also joys of the common man living amidst the devastations created by the political decadence, economic exploitation and social chaos, and the moral and spiritual hollowness. Ehsas's poetry attempts to achieve the rare combination of the simplicity of poetic expression and the intricacies of experience. While taking blind nights into the uncharted spaces of imagination and experience he never loses touch with the ground, where he really belongs. The Sahitya Akademi has published a selection of his poetry entitled Main Rona Chaahta Hoon (2003). Another collection has been published titled as 'Shayari Nahin Hai Yeh' (2011). A new book of his poem titled as 'Ye Jism Ka Tasawwuf will soon be published.

				He has written 4 books focussing on how BJP evolved since the days of Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath. His latest book - Sangham Sharnam Gachchhami on the journey of RSS,BJP, Kal, Aaj Aur Kal drew a lot of attention where he thoroughly analyzed the rise of BJP and its place and future in Indian Politics.
