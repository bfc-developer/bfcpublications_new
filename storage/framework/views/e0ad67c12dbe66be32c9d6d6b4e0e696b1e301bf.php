                        Looking for an <b>eBook publisher in India</b> can be an uphill task, especially for budding authors
                        and novelists. The reason; new authors are not aware of the aspects of <b>eBook publication</b>, and
                        therefore are clueless about “what to look for in a publisher?” To understand self publishing
                        better, one needs to know its roots; how this space grew from insignificance to dominance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Self-publishing was not very popular in India, at least in the earlier decades. However, due to
                        constant rejections and lack of transparency, certain popular authors published their books through
                        a <a href="<?php echo e(url('/')); ?>" class="text-danger"><b>self publisher</b></a>. Many of these books went on to become bestsellers, a development that
                        propelled <b>online publishing</b> in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Suddenly, <b>eBook publications</b> started coming up all over the country, many
                        of them pushing innocent newbies to opt for one-size-fits-all plans. The fundamental problem with
                        pre-cooked plans is they do not account for the genre of the book. This affects the book’s
                        marketability. Simply put, an academic book needs to be marketed differently when compared with
                        fiction, and so on. This lack of flexibility is the biggest drawback with <b>eBook publishers in
                            India</b>. Getting a book published is only half the work done; selling it is the key to
                        success. At BFC Publications, marketing books sufficiently is equally important. We make sure that
                        the books published by us are showcased properly. The exercise involves identifying readers suited
                        to the book, and targeting them through various marketing tactics.</p>
