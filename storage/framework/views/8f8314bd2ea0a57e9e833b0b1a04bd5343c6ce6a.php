                        <p>Writing a book is a significant accomplishment in itself but is entirely different from
                            publishing a story. Self-publishing a book might seem even more tricky than writing one. Let's
                            say the book you were working on is finished and needs to be published and distributed to
                            everyone. Those who have previously published are aware of the next steps. However, if this is
                            your first attempt at self-publishing a book, you most likely have no idea what to do next or
                            how to <b>self-publish a book in India</b>. Well, don't worry! Just follow the instructions
                            below, and you'll be good to go.</p>
