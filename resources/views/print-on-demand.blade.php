                        What is <b>Print-on-Demand Book publishing (PoD)</b> and how does it benefit those looking to get
                        self published? This, you’re probably wondering. Lucky you, we anticipated your dilemma in advance.
                        Just read on and you’ll know whatever there is to know about this publishing model.

                        In layman terms, <b>Print-on-Demand publishing</b> is a cost-effective book printing service that
                        can be availed by an author looking to get <a href="{{ url('/') }}"
                            class="text-danger fw-bold">self
                            published</a>. Under <b>on demand printing </b>,authors
                        can get limited copies of their books printed upon request, be it twenty or a thousand. Simply put,
                        this method allows publishers to provide books to authors at a per copy cost; the bigger the order
                        size, the lesser the print cost. Although the cost of each <b>print-on-demand book</b> copy is
                        marginally higher as compared to <b>offset printing</b>, it is easier to accommodate since the
                        author can order fewer prints. Long story short, <b>on demand publishing</b> saves authors the money
                        they would have to spend to run initial prints of their book under <b>offset printing</b>.

                        <p>We’ve already talked about this key <b>benefit of Print-on-Demand publishing</b>. Herein, the
                            author can request limited prints of his book and save the money he would have to spend to run

                        <p>With PoD, it’s easier to make changes in existing books, since you don’t have to worry about the
                            huge inventory that usually accompanies <b>offset printing</b>. Print-on-demand is especially
                            advisable if you are a new author, given that first-timers are more likely to miss omitting
                            certain minute errors in the manuscript.</p>
