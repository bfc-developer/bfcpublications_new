The reason; new authors are not aware of the aspects of <b>eBook publication</b>, and therefore are clueless about “what to look for in a publisher?” To understand self publishing better, one needs  to know its roots; how this space grew from insignificance to dominance.  \n\n                    </p>\n                    \n                    <p>Self-publishing was not very popular in India, at least in the earlier decades. However, due to constant rejections and lack of transparency, certain popular authors published their books through  a <b><a href=\"https://bfcpublications.com/\"> self publisher</a></b>. Many of these books went on to become bestsellers, a development that propelled <b>online publishing</b> in the country.\n                    </p>\n\n                   <p>Suddenly, <b>eBook publications</b> started coming up all over the country, many of them pushing  innocent newbies to opt for one-size-fits-all plans. The fundamental problem with pre-cooked plans  is they do not account for the genre of the book. This affects the book’s marketability. Simply put, an  academic book needs to be marketed differently when compared with fiction, and so on. This lack of  flexibility is the biggest drawback with <b>eBook publishers in India.</b> Getting a book published is only  half the work done; selling it is the key to success. At BFC Publications, marketing books sufficiently is equally important. We make sure that the books published by us are showcased properly. The  exercise involves identifying readers suited to the book, and targeting them through various  marketing tactics.  \n                    </p>\n                  </div>\n                  <div className=\"col-lg-6 col-sm-12\">\n                    <img className=\"img-responsive  about-img-1\" src=\"assets/images/ebook.webp\" alt=\"ebook publication\" />\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"row\">\n                  <div className=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\n                    \n                   \n\n                  </div>\n                  </div>\n\n                    <div className=\"row\">\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12\">\n                            <div className=\"full text_align_left\">\n                            <hr/><br/>\n                            <h2 className=\"text-blue text-center\">Top eBook selling platforms in India</h2>\n                            <br/>\n                            <p>Any discussion on self publishing is not complete unless it covers <b> top eBook selling platforms in  India.</b> Why?
