                        Choosing the right publisher is one of the most important decisions you’ll make. Here’s a short checklist to help you compare options among <em>book publishing companies in New Delhi</em>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Inspect past books for editing quality and design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Ask for concrete examples of campaigns and results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Get clear contracts on royalties, rights, and costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Ensure they provide a dedicated point of contact and realistic timelines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Author Feedback:</strong> Talk to previously published authors about their experience.</li>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        If retaining creative control is essential, look specifically at <em>self book publishing services in New Delhi</em> and compare who genuinely supports author autonomy while offering professional services.
