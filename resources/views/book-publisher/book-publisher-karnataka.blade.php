                        <li><b>Research Their Past Work:</b> Look at books they’ve published. Does the quality match your expectations?</li>
                        <li><b>Understand Their Process:</b> Some publishers only help with printing, while others offer full-service packages including marketing. BFC is known for the latter, which is why they’re one of the top publishers for authors in Karnataka.</li>
                        <li><b>Talk to Previous Authors:</b> Genuine reviews and testimonials from authors will tell you more than any advertisement.</li>
                        <li><b>Evaluate Transparency:</b> Some self book publishing services in Karnataka may lure you with low prices but hide essential costs. Always go with publishers who are upfront about pricing and royalties.</li>
